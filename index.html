                <h1>Information About Paris!</h1>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <p>Paris, France's capital, is a major European city and a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy and culture. Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine. Beyond such landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the 12th-century, Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral, the city is known for its cafe culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©.</p>

                    <p>My favorite place to visit is Paris, France. Even if I have only been there once, I loved it! There was so much history and beauty there. The Eiffel Tower was just as or even more beautiful in-person! I also visited the Louvre which is where the Mona Lisa is kept. It was a little crowded, but I still loved it. One of my favorite parts were the double decker busses. There were two floors on a bus! All of it was amazing!</p>
