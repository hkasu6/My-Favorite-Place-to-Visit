            <p>My favorite place to visit is Paris, France. Even if I have only been there once, I loved it! There was so much history and beauty there. The Eiffel Tower was just as or even more beautiful in-person! I also visited the Louvre which is where the Mona Lisa is kept. It was a little crowded, but I still loved it. One of my favorite parts were the double decker busses. There were two floors on a bus! All of it was amazing!
